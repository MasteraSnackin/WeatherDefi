# WeatherShield DeFi - Parametric Insurance for Climate Risk 🌦️

A solution that automates weather-triggered payouts using smart contracts and external data oracles. Built on Ethereum with Flare Network integration for reliable weather data verification.

## Overview

WeatherShield DeFi addresses the critical challenge of climate risk management for farmers by providing automated, transparent insurance policies triggered by verifiable weather conditions. The platform eliminates manual claims processing, improves trust, and delivers rapid financial protection against weather-related losses.

Traditional insurance suffers from slow, bureaucratic processes that leave farmers vulnerable when they need support most. Our solution leverages blockchain technology to provide instant financial relief based on objective weather data, enabling farmers to focus on production rather than navigating complex claim procedures.

WeatherDeFi addresses the critical challenge of climate risk management for farmers by providing **automated, transparent insurance policies** triggered by verifiable weather conditions. The platform eliminates manual claims processing, improves trust, and delivers rapid financial protection against weather-related losses. 🌦️

Traditional insurance suffers from slow, bureaucratic processes that leave farmers vulnerable when they need support most. Our solution leverages **blockchain technology** to provide instant financial relief based on objective weather data, enabling farmers to focus on production rather than navigating complex claim procedures. ⏱️💡

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Automated Insurance Payouts:** Smart contracts automatically trigger payouts when predefined weather conditions are met (e.g., temperature below freezing).
- 🔍 **Transparent Policy Management:** All transactions and contract terms are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
- 🌐 **Multi-Source Weather Data:** Oracle integration with multiple data sources ensures accuracy and reliability.
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface:** React-based frontend for easy policy purchase and management.
- ✅ **Weather Data Verification:** JQ-based transformation and verification of external API data.
- 📉 **Predefined Triggers:** Clear thresholds (like temperature below 0°C) for claim activation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system consists of three primary components:

1. ⛓️ **Smart Contracts (Blockchain Layer)**
2. ☁️ **Oracle Network (Data Layer)**
3. 💻 **Frontend Application (User Interface Layer)**

## 🤖 ParametricInsurance Contract
- 🌐 Interface for JSON API verification
- 📋 Mapping to store policies for each policyholder
- 📜 Struct to represent an insurance policy
- 🌡️ Temperature threshold for claim payout (0°C = 273.15K * 1e6)
int256 public constant TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 273150000;


## Key Contract Functions  🔑
contract ParametricInsurance {
**Array to store active policyholder addresses**
address[] public policyholders;

**Interface for JSON API verification**
IJsonApiVerification public immutable jsonApiAttestationVerification;

**Mapping to store policies for each policyholder**
mapping(address => Policy) public policies;

**Struct to represent an insurance policy**

**Temperature** threshold for claim payout (0°C = 273.15K * 1e6)
int256 public constant TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 273150000;

## Events for logging
- event PolicyPurchased(address indexed policyholder, uint256 premium, uint256 coverageAmount);
- event ClaimPaid(address indexed policyholder, uint256 amount);
- event WeatherDataAdded(int256 temperature, uint256 timestamp);
}

**Key Contract Functions**

**Oracle Integration**
The dApp uses Flare Network's JSON API verification system to securely bring weather data on-chain:

## 🔄 Data Flow Process
1. **🤖 Smart contract** Policies automatically request weather data updates through Flare Network integration
2. **🌦️ Flare oracle fetches** Flare oracles collect raw data from multiple API sources (OpenWeatherMap, NOAA, etc.)
3. **🛠️ Data is transformed** Data is standardized using JQ filters:
4. **🔒 Merkle proof** Validated data gets hashed into Merkle trees with only roots stored on-chain 
5. **⛓️ Data** is decoded on-chain for policy execution


## 🖥️ Frontend Components

- 🔍 **Oracle Data Validation**: Multi-source verification prevents manipulation  
- 🔑 **Access Control**: Critical functions restricted to contract owner  
- ⏳ **Time-Locked Funds**: Policy funds held in contract until conditions met  
- ✍️ **Multi-Signature Deployment**: Production contracts require multiple approvals
